# Lab9 - Black Box Problem

Given a black-box fitness function, our goal is to solve problem instances 1, 2, 5 and 10 with the minimum number of fitness calls. 

## Solution

I implemented a **GA algorithm** to solve the problem instace 1. \
I added a **extiction** process based on the population convergence, to promote the **diversity** for the instances 2 and 5. \
I added a **Islands** model with migrations between the islands, and a **two level diversity** implementation for the problem instance 10.

## Collaborations
I collaborated with [Davide Sferrazza s326619](https://github.com/FarInHeight/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main). \
For the problem instances 1 and 2 also with [Alexandro Buffa s316999](https://github.com/ExalFabu/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main), [Simone Giambrone s317002](https://github.com/JustLooller/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main) and [Andrea Panuccio s294603](https://github.com/AndPan96/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main).
